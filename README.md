## 🚀 Project Overview

Welcome to the "Predicting Social Media Addiction: A Machine Learning Approach" repository. This project is designed to harness advanced machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of social media addiction based on user interaction data. Our goal is to provide actionable insights that can aid mental health professionals and social platforms in understanding and mitigating addictive behaviors.

## 🎯 Objective

The aim of this project is to develop and refine predictive models that can effectively use behavioral data to assess the risk of social media addiction. Key project objectives include:
- Conducting a comprehensive analysis of user activity and engagement metrics.
- Utilizing feature engineering to uncover the most impactful predictors of addiction.
- Developing robust machine learning models to classify users as potentially addicted or not.

## 📊 Data Description

The dataset includes anonymized user data from various social platforms, encompassing diverse metrics:
- **Session Duration**: Total time spent per login.
- **Activity Frequency**: Daily count of logins.
- **Engagement Type**: Interactions such as likes, comments, and shares.
- **Content Types**: Varieties of content consumed.

Data privacy is paramount, and all datasets are compliant with relevant data protection regulations to ensure user anonymity.

## 🛠 Methodology

The project follows a structured approach to predictive modeling:
1. **Data Acquisition**: Securely sourcing and anonymizing social media usage data.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing data to ensure quality and consistency.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Developing new features that effectively capture behavioral nuances.
4. **Model Development**: Implementing various algorithms (Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks) to model addiction likelihood.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance through metrics like ROC-AUC, Accuracy, and Confusion Matrix.
6. **Optimization**: Fine-tuning models and features based on performance assessments.
